Organization:
     - Folder Prizes with Gamma, Normal and Uniform distributions:
     
          . Has 5 spreadsheets with the values referring to the prizes used in the construction of the 
     instances generated for the PCTBP-II. They are arranged as follows:
     
                * First.ods: Prizes for the instances with suffix **a**;
                
                * Second.ods: Prizes for the instances with suffix **b**;

                * Fourth.ods: Prizes for the instances with suffix **d**;
                
                * Fifth.ods: Prizes for the instances with suffix **e**;
                
          . Each spreadsheets has 4 columns. The first one refers to the airports in the instances and the 
     other three are respectively the prizes obtained by the Uniform distribution (prefix **U**), Normal dis-
     tribution (prefix **N**) and the Gamma distribution (prefix **G**);
     
          . All the obtained prizes are in the range of 10 to 100.
